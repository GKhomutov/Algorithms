/* THEORY */

// a = SG(A) is a number such that the game A + Nim(a) is winning for the 2nd player
// If SG(A) exists, then it's unique

// If A is a symmetric game with perfect information in which the states don't repeat, then SG(A) is well-defined:
// SG(A) = mex{SG(A_1), ..., SG(A_k)}, where A_i - states that can be entered from the state A
// SG(A) == 0  <=>  A is winning for the 2nd player
// SG(A + B) = SG(A) ^ SG(B)
